# ADR-002: Frontend Technology Stack

**Status**: Active  
**Date**: 2026-01-22  
**Decision Makers**: Project team

## Context
Need a modern, performant frontend application with offline capabilities and fast development iteration.

## Decision
Build a Progressive Web App (PWA) using:

### Core Framework
- **React 18.3.1**: UI library for component-based development
- **TypeScript 5.7.3**: Type safety and improved developer experience

### Build Tool
- **Vite 5.4.12**: Fast HMR, optimized builds, modern ESM-based development
- **@vitejs/plugin-react 4.3.4**: Official React integration for Vite

### PWA Capabilities
- **vite-plugin-pwa 0.21.0**: Service worker generation, offline support, install prompts

### Development
- Port: 5173 (Vite default)
- Scripts:
  - `pnpm dev:app`: Start development server
  - `pnpm build`: Production build with Vite
  - `pnpm typecheck`: TypeScript validation

## Rationale

### React
- Industry standard with extensive ecosystem
- Strong TypeScript support
- Large talent pool

### Vite over Create React App / webpack
- 10-100x faster HMR during development
- Modern ESM-first approach
- Simpler configuration
- Better tree-shaking and optimized production builds

### TypeScript
- Catch errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code through types

### PWA Support
- Offline-first capabilities essential for mobile app feel
- Native-like installation experience
- Progressive enhancement for users without PWA support

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fast development iteration with Vite HMR
- Type safety reduces runtime errors
- PWA provides app-like experience without app store
- Modern build output with automatic code splitting

### Negative
- React adds ~50KB to bundle size
- PWA service workers add complexity to caching strategy
- Requires modern browser support (no IE11)

## Implementation
- Application located in `apps/boladas/`
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Vite config at `apps/boladas/vite.config.ts`
- PWA manifest and service worker generated by vite-plugin-pwa
